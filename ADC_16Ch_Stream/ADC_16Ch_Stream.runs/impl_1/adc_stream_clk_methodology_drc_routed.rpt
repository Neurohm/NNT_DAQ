Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock mmcm0_clk0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 24 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins okHI/mmcm0/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '7' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

Hold option missing in multicycle path constraint  
A multicycle constraint has been set to override the setup relationship, but no multicycle constraint has been defined to change the hold relationship. As a result, the default hold for those paths is derived from the setup and may not be evaluated as expected.
